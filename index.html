            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there I am samuel but you can call me <strong>sam</strong> I am 17 and I am pc enthusiast aka nerd of

                but I have a very good English level, most of the people would describe me as a quiet person or "loner"
                i
                dont
                have many friends(or atleast people i consider so) you can write me at any hour on this <a

            <img src="resource/1714376581945664.png" width="500" height="300" alt="from evangelion azuka"><br></img>
            <p>a poem i like:</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbOP8fTMXsA">
                i would like very much to live in a small hole in the ground like a mole a small hole for an even
                smaller<br>
                mole maybe dug into the side of a hill and i will close off the entrance to keep out the chill of the
                winters,<br>
                heat of the summers no one would know, but please tell my mother iâ€™m sorry, iâ€™m sorry but it had to be
                done<br>
                because when you canâ€™t run from the invisible weight of the world teetering on your shoulder blades just
                <br>
                smother yourself with dirt bury yourself alive so at least then you know where the suffocation is coming
                from<br>
                because when i can feel my stomach being pulled out through my lips and forced back down again whenever
                <br>
                its decided so iâ€™d at least like to know whoâ€™s responsible so i can thank them for giving me a gag
                reflex<br>
                crafted from steel and the artistry to construct a creative, well-rounded list of a thousand and one
                ways<br>
                i could die iâ€™ve learned that when fire and ice combine they donâ€™t divide, they multiply two extremes
                donâ€™t<br>
                cancel they intensify and yes thereâ€™s something bringing the cold but oh i bring the burn if i was a
                mole<br>
                in the side of a hill i wouldnâ€™t seek that same masochistic thrill that keeps my human heart humming
                human<br>
                mind numbing someone please help me, i think iâ€™m becoming insignificant again thatâ€™s the third time
                today<br>
                a mole wouldnâ€™t cry when asked of its day when i was little i was told i had an excellent imagination
                who<br>
                ever would have guessed iâ€™d use it in the creation of my own personal hell where everythingâ€™s my fault
                and<br>
                no matter how small i get i always take up too much space while at the same time taking up no space
                because<br>
                have you ever thought about how big space is everyoneâ€™s so small but iâ€™m the biggest small of them all
                not<br>
                if i was a mole in the side of a hill with neither the heat nor the chill itâ€™s quiet and cosy but
                really,<br>
                thatâ€™s silly and i donâ€™t suppose we could come to some sort of agreement for thereâ€™s lives to be
                lived<br>
                business to conduct thereâ€™s moments to experience and thereâ€™s nothing to discuss things to think too
                much<br>
                everything to think too much i always think too much<br>
