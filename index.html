    <p>a poem i like:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbOP8fTMXsA">
        i would like very much to live in a small hole in the ground like a mole a small hole for an even
        smaller<br>
        mole maybe dug into the side of a hill and i will close off the entrance to keep out the chill of the
        winters,<br>
        heat of the summers no one would know, but please tell my mother iâ€™m sorry, iâ€™m sorry but it had to be
        done<br>
        because when you canâ€™t run from the invisible weight of the world teetering on your shoulder blades just
        <br>
        smother yourself with dirt bury yourself alive so at least then you know where the suffocation is coming
        from<br>
        because when i can feel my stomach being pulled out through my lips and forced back down again whenever <br>
        its decided so iâ€™d at least like to know whoâ€™s responsible so i can thank them for giving me a gag
        reflex<br>
        crafted from steel and the artistry to construct a creative, well-rounded list of a thousand and one
        ways<br>
        i could die iâ€™ve learned that when fire and ice combine they donâ€™t divide, they multiply two extremes
        donâ€™t<br>
        cancel they intensify and yes thereâ€™s something bringing the cold but oh i bring the burn if i was a
        mole<br>
        in the side of a hill i wouldnâ€™t seek that same masochistic thrill that keeps my human heart humming
        human<br>
        mind numbing someone please help me, i think iâ€™m becoming insignificant again thatâ€™s the third time
        today<br>
        a mole wouldnâ€™t cry when asked of its day when i was little i was told i had an excellent imagination
        who<br>
        ever would have guessed iâ€™d use it in the creation of my own personal hell where everythingâ€™s my fault
        and<br>
        no matter how small i get i always take up too much space while at the same time taking up no space
        because<br>
        have you ever thought about how big space is everyoneâ€™s so small but iâ€™m the biggest small of them all
        not<br>
        if i was a mole in the side of a hill with neither the heat nor the chill itâ€™s quiet and cosy but
        really,<br>
        thatâ€™s silly and i donâ€™t suppose we could come to some sort of agreement for thereâ€™s lives to be lived<br>
        business to conduct thereâ€™s moments to experience and thereâ€™s nothing to discuss things to think too
        much<br>
        everything to think too much i always think too much<br>
